I'm not finding the intructions hyper easy. I bet sudo apt-get install opencv would work pretty well, but i want some latest features (aruco support in the contrib?)

This is useful

okay git clone Â both the contrib

https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib

and the main project directory

i have a fresh installation of ubuntu

First I had a error in the cmake process

sudo apt-get build-dep opencv

I had an error about no sources. Had to uncomment the dep-src lines in /etc/apt/sources.list file. The ran sudo apt-get update. Now it installs a ton

Running this in the created build directory. Have to adjust the path to modules to suit what you've done

    
    cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules ..



    
    make -j7


sudo make install



seems to have installed python bindings. Good.
