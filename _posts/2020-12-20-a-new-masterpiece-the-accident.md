For my birthday this year we carried on a grand tradition of producing a movie [like last year](http://www.philipzucker.com/our-latest-film-ouvre-the-wassenroid/). I was feeling lazy before we started but I'm glad it happened. Idea thought of at 12:30, filmed by 3:30, edited by 7. That's the way to do it! Quite a day!
