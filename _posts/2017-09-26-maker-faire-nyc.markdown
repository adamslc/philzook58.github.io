My first Maker Faire. Saw some neat stuff. Good energy. [Declan](https://declanoller.com/2017/09/25/back-to-the-blog-and-the-nyc-maker-faire/) made a write up.

Things to investigate:

CircuitStudio / circuitmaker - circuit design software a la Fusion 360 business model from altium. Windows only? Don't like that

OctoPart - electronic components footprints and BOM

Mesh - Little IoT buttons and sensors

Sam Zeloof - Smart ass kid making his own IC [sam.zeloof.xyz](http://sam.zeloof.xyz)

Tindie - Can I buy useful boards from here?

[www.photogrammetry.today](http://www.photogrammetry.today) - Maybe some photogrammetry tips? Hmm. Not anything there yet

[plantum.ai](http://plantum.ai) another really smart kid doing machine learning

Makerlogic - [www.makerlogic.com](http://www.makerlogic.com) A guy pushing FPGA education. Max10 based board. Not much there yet

[https://shop.openh.io/collections/all](https://shop.openh.io/collections/all) - 4G enabled rapsberry pi shields

[www.up-board.org](http://www.up-board.org) - small form factor intel computers and accessories. Keep an eye out for update in realsense in October.

[makerscad.com](https://makerscad.com/) - an interesting combo scratch and openscad javascript kind of thing. Also has physics engines?
