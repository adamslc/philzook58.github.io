So I'm intrigued by the promising use of python, fast dev and all that.

I'm having a lot of trouble getting buildozer to work though

My application keeps crashing.

I have not successfully gotten buildozer to not crash.

Maybe it'll work on iphone?

However, the kivy launcher app seems to be workingon my android (Galaxy SIII).

make a folder on the drive the phone appears as called kivy

Then another folder for each program with the python and an android.txt

Plyer has the juiciest stuff

Mmm Juicy.
