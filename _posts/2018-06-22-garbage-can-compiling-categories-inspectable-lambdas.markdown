There are a couple kinds of functions that we can turn into totally inspectable data.

Linear functions can be reconstituted into a matrix if you give a basis of vectors.

Functions from enumerable types can be turned into a lookup table

Sufficiently polymorphic functions are another example though. forall a. a-> a is commonly known to only be id. The same goes for fst = forall a b. (a,b)->a and snd and swap and all the nesting of . These functions have exactly one inhabiting value (excluding internal churning and the possibility of going into an infinite loop).

So the type directly tells us the implementation

forall a. (a,a)->a is similar. It can only be fst or snd. Types that reuse a type parameter in the input can only be permutations.

I've been trying to find a way to take a written lambda and convert it to data automatically and have been having trouble.

An opaque type that we have hidden the contructors to is the same (T,T)->T can only be fst or snd specialized to T since we can't possibly destruct on T.

We can figure out which one by giving a labeled example to that function and then inspecting a single output.Â  This gives the permutation and duplication that was done.

Similarly for T -> Either T T

Once we have this, we can (Hopefully) reinterpret this lambda in terms of a monoidal category.

What about TH? Also the new quantified constraints extensions might be helpful?





Ok. A Different approach. This works much better to what I had in mind. you can write aribatrary (\(x,y,) -> (y,x)) tuple like lambdas and it will convert them to a category. I really had to hack around to get the thing to compile. Like that Pick typeclass, what the heck? Why can I get defaults values in type families but not in typeclasses?

It is all decidedly not typesafe. You can get totally nonsensical things to compile to something. However if you stick to lambdas, you'll be ok. Maybe.

No on further review this does not work. I got tricked that the type seemed ok at a certain point.Â  A couple problems arise upon actual application. Since the idea is to drive the form based on the type variables upon actual application to something that has types of the same form it gets all screwed up. Also tons of instances are overlapping, although I think this is fixable.

Maybe what I need is existential types that can't ever unify together accidentally.

A couple thought on typelevel programming principles:



 	
  1. Typeclasses are hard to get default cases. You want to use type families if that is what you want

 	
  2. Typeclasses need unique stuff to appear on the right hand side. Only 1 pattern should match. You might need to add extra parameters to match to which you can force on the left hand side of the instance

 	
  3. ~ type equality is real useful

 	
  4. 



An alternative to using lambda is to use an explicit Proxy. The type variables are basically just as good for syntactic purposes (a touch more noisy).
