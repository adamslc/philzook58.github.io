Seems hella useful

puts some data from my boy and puts it in file ab120_10.dat

    
    rtl_sdr -f 120000000 -g 40 -n 20480000 ab120_10s.dat


-g sets gain. -f sets central frequency. Defaults to 2.048 samps/s. The n is number of samples which is 10x that so that means 10s.

I basically reimplemented the example code from matlab into Â numpy.

A surprising glitch is that using pcolormesh with the fft/spectrogram is that you need to use the fftshift function for it to work right (hypothetically, it feels like this shouldn't be necessary).

I was confused for a long time by this. The example code for spectrogram doesn't use a complex signal so I figured that was the problem, but I could see the spike if I just plt.plot() a slice of time. This is bad behavior. I do not see this documented anywhere obvious.

    
    rtl_sdr -f 101140000 -g 40 -n 20480000 ab120_10s.dat



    
    from sys import argv
    #This will allow a command line assignment of the filename
    #script, filename = argv
    import struct
    import numpy as np
    from scipy import signal
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import scipy as sp
    
    filename = "ab120_10s.dat"
    
    rawdata = np.fromfile(filename,dtype=np.uint8)
    real = rawdata[0::2]-127.5
    imag = rawdata[1::2]-127.5
    vals = real + 1.j * imag
    f, t, Sxx = signal.spectrogram(vals, 2048000,nperseg=512)
    
    plt.pcolormesh(t[::100], np.fft.fftshift(f), np.fft.fftshift(Sxx[:,::100],axes=0))
    
    plt.ylabel('Frequency [Hz]')
    plt.xlabel('Time [sec]')
    plt.show()

Radio reference. Interesting listing of local radios. I don't know how to decode p25. Some kind of digital radio standard

Maybe this is the right thing

How did people do anything before the internet?

The Raw IQ data is unsigned byte alternating I then Q

The rtl_tcp server serves up this data stream.

It also accepts data commands, but I do not see where this is documented.
