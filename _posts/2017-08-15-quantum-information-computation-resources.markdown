A playlist I keep in no particular order. In particular I recommend Gottesman's Quantum Information Course from Perimeter Institute which has tons of other interesting physics courses and colloquia as well. Â Also check out the CSSQI lectures. Some of these videos are just links to a whole glut of connected videos from the same people, so look on the sidebar and at other videos from the same users.

Preskill's classic notes. I don't find them very approachable?

Quantum Computing since Democritus. Unbelievable.

The Simons Institute has had some interesting workshops. I coincidentally have been interested in SAT problems recently coming from a logic side.

Recommended Books:

Nielson and Chaung - The standard

Kitaev and other - Classical and Quantum Information

Mermin

Mark Wilde - Quantum Information. Much less quantum computation. Good different perspective.



Interesting Languages - Both have tutorial videos available

Quipper - Haskell based

Liquid - Microsofty F# based



IBM Quantum Experience - Let's you run on real hardware!
