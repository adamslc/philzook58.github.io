title: Has My Blog Been Hacked?
wordpress_id: 2639

This morning I got a DM saying that a third party had seen some kind of plugin installation popup show up on my website, specifically on my about me page. 







If you experience anything like this PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  (comments below, or DM me @sandmouth [https://twitter.com/SandMouth](https://twitter.com/SandMouth) )







I haven't been able to replicate this behavior in any way, nor can anyone else I've asked, upon cursory examination of the code of my blog I can't find anything, everything is up to date, and scans aren't finding anything.







Maybe it's time to finally transfer out of wordpress. I liked that it was easy, but the internet is too scary.







Also, if you're a hacker, please pick on someone else. I really like my blog.
