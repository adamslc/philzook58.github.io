Based on http://fpga4fun.com/PongGame.html

767 was the value checked for at 25Mhz. This is a count of 768.

I doubled it to 1535. and added one to all references to Counter X.

I am confused on these values. References I'm finding say to shoot for 31.5kHz but this works out to 32.5khz?

50e6/31.46875e3 givesÂ 1588.87785501. Ok. That works too. I guess the monitor is just flexible.









I got an error for can't use pin 101 which is V sync

This helped

Need to disable nCEO which is using that pin



    
    module vga_test (
    	output vga_h_sync,
    	output vga_v_sync,
    	output R,
    	output G,
    	output B,
    	input clk
    	
    );
    
    
    reg [10:0] CounterX;
    reg [8:0] CounterY;
    wire CounterXmaxed = (CounterX==1535);
    
    always @(posedge clk)
    if(CounterXmaxed)
      CounterX <= 0;
    else
      CounterX <= CounterX + 1;
    
    always @(posedge clk)
    if(CounterXmaxed)
        CounterY <= CounterY + 1;
    	 
    
    reg vga_HS, vga_VS;
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
      vga_HS <= (CounterX[10:5]==0);   // active for 16 clocks
      vga_VS <= (CounterY==0);   // active for 768 clocks
    end
    
    assign vga_h_sync = ~vga_HS;
    assign vga_v_sync = ~vga_VS;
    
    
    assign R =  CounterX[9];//CounterY[3] | (CounterX==256);
    assign G = CounterX[8];//(CounterX[6] ^ CounterX[7]) | (CounterX==256);
    assign B = CounterX[7]; //CounterX[5] | (CounterX==256);
    
    
    endmodule


Alright. It appears to work. That is a good start.
