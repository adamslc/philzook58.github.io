Got a hackrf. Sqeet.

    hackrf_transfer -r /dev/null -s 20000000


Made Â quick little fm transmitter.

Only goes a couple feet, so should be okay wherever you do it.

Also doing it on our ham freqeuncies, so doubly so

Audio source comes in from the microphone

Gotta resample

Should resample before fm-mod?

When I did, the signal looked better, but deviation from central frequency was way too high. Could low pass, but probably not the way to go

More to come probably
