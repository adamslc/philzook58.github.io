Huh. This doesn't embed very well. Maybe you're better off just clicking into the thing. It's nice not to let things rot too long though. *shrug*







Other ideas: Can I not come up with some scheme to use Sum of Squares for rigorous upper and lower bound regions like in [https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/TaylorModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/TaylorModels.jl) ? Maybe a next post.
