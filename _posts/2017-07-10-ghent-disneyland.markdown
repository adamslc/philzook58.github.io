Today we arrived in Ghent. We're staying on this eco hostel boat. It's really nice.

We wondered around the old city. It's like boom boom boom down there. The churches are bonkers.

I feel like there kind of was less interesting going on. Yes the old buildings were insane and nonstop, but that got a touch old? Am I already getting blas√© about Europe shit?

Despite that misgiving, again it was basically the most gorgeous city I've ever seen.

had waterzooi for linner. Very good. It's like a creamed chicken soup with lots of veggies. Matt is freaking out (in a positive way) about his.
