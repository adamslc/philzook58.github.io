we made a quick stop in Antwerp on the way to Amsterdam. Not so much to see there really. Cool train station. Got some subway. Chicken teriyaki

amsterdam was neat

we were there for a day.

we didn't really go into any museums but we walked by them.

the Anne frank house and van gig museum

I saw a guy trying to steal a bicycle
