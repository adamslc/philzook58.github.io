If we specify fo example that $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(L)=0$ we can just lop off the first and last column of the matrix, making it rectangular and invertible. It is this fact that makes the boundary conditions an ESSENTIAL part of the Green's Function. It does not make sense without them and different boundary conditions give different green's function"
