  * Owicki-Gries, Ashcroft. Floyd is different from hoare?
  * Resource invariant
  * schneider - on concurrent programming
  * safety v livness. safety is abscence of bad. liveness is guarantee of good. Terminating is liveness. asbence of deadlock is safety
  * mutex, semaphore, monitor
  * threads, processes, coroutines.
