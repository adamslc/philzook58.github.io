How do you get good at deep learning?
How do you even know you're on the right track?




Tips:
Try to overfit. Sometimes I see people suggest try to overfit and then regularize
Overfitting = doing well on training and doing poorly on test

Try to give it a little longer
Normalize and zero mean inputs?
Fiddling with hyper parameters
Get your iterations fast. You're gonna be trying lots of bullshit
Try to simplify your problem - A general problem solving tactic
Ng had some good tips


Dropout ~ bagging. Interesting
data augmentation. Adding adversarial examples.


attention - transformer netowrk
proof search - Lerin, openai guy

autoencoder

boltzmann machines?
