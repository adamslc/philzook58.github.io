I've been feeling like i should be doing manual hoare logic/ imperative proofs

There is a vast assortment of tools out there that aren't proof assistants.

JML, ESC/java https://www.openjml.org/ whiley

It's interesting that logical psecs are so foreign, and somewhat longwinded when applied to imperative code,
that they aren't that much more understandable or high assurance.
Really it might be about formally proving equaivlance between just specs in different languages.
Python and C for example.


A good question is: what are interesting programs to prove?
1. List manipulation
2. sorts
3. red black trees
4. find
