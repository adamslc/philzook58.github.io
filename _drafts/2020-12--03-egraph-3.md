title: "EGraphs Part III "
---

In an application where we are trying to do equational reasoning, we have some pile of universally quantified equations like $\forall x. x + zero = x$ .
The e-graph is storing ground terms, ones that do not represent a universal quantification. The e-graph stores the fact $seven + zero = seven$ and $two + zero = two$ separately even though these are instantiations of the same underlying fact.

A natural approach to equational rewriting is to turn your equations into rewrite rules, which are a related but distinct thing. Rewrite rules pattern match a left hand side and replace it with a right hand side. 
Rewrite rules have an asymmetric flavor between the right and left hand side, whereas equality is more symmetric.
Applications of rewrite rules do no necessarily commute. Applying rule 1 and then rule 2 is not necessarily the same as applying 2 then 1.
One can then apply in some order the rewrite rules, hoping for the best, or maintain a set of all terms reachable.


SymbolicUtils arranges its matchers to take an expression, a dictionary of already known bindings, and a callback function that takes a new dictionary and the number of elements matched. Here's a snippet from the library for comparison.

[link](https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/SymbolicUtils.jl/blob/cd18c76fd09078c38393b398e681329f257ecfe8/src/matchers.jl#L1)
```julia

#### Pattern matching
### Matching procedures
# A matcher is a function which takes 3 arguments
# 1. Expression
# 2. Dictionary
# 3. Callback: takes arguments Dictionary × Number of elements matched
#
function matcher(val::Any)
    function literal_matcher(next, data, bindings)
        islist(data) && isequal(car(data), val) ? next(bindings, 1) : nothing
    end
end
```

Make egraph generic like egg by implementing in terms of a children and istree function.
Kind of how symbiolic utils does it.

end

generic egraph over anything that implements istree yada yada. call getchildren(::T) rather than .args
children!() tpo update children
children
Basically converts it to


$\forall x. x + zero = x$ becomes 

The equations that produce these equivalences

In application to finding new rewrites, we need to be adding new equalities to the EGraph.





Duality
If you reverse all edges, DAGs remain DAGs.
Unification propagates downwards
Congruence closure propagates upwards

What if we reversed the dag and hash consed all the parents? How similar would congruence closure look like to unifacation

Hashcons Ids vs union find ids. "Fundamental" indirections. The catlab people have convinced me that there is some fundamaenetal character to the indirection that occurs via foreign keys inb databases. So should we too consider there to be a fundamental character to the Ids?
memo :: f(Id) -> Id. Set of endofunctors f on Id? 
A unification relation ~ ( term(x) , otherterm(x) ) . The signatures of the two don't have to match, but the variable sets do. Whereas the opposite is true of composition.
 f Id  <-  Id  ->  g Id  ~~~~ g Id2 <- Id2 -> h Id2.
 Pullback gives Id3 and equivalence set of Id1 Id2.
  Maybe consider the hash cons version?   Id <- Id -> Id
  the met parts perform union [ 2,6,8,1]   [2,5,7,9,5,3]
  No it makes more sense going the other way.
    Stuff -> EquivClas <- Stuff   union find
    [1 ,4,5]   
    Then 
function compose_cospan(f,g)
   unionfind = IntDisjointSet( max(f.apex, g.apex))
   for (x,y) in zip( f.right, g.left)
     merge(x,y) 
    end
    newleft = find_root.( f.left)
    NEWRIGHT = find_root(g.right)
    # maybe a normalization step to return to a range 1..Nequiv_class
    CoSpan( newapex, newleft, newright )
end

It does seem like this makes sense. I dunno what you do with it.
I mean, a pushout _is_ union right?
This is in catlab under colimit.
Does this suggest that maybe I should be implementing EGraphs as a CSet?
There is this complicated schema of Equiavlanece nodes and hash Ids.
    [1,56,7,8,  ] 


EGraphs as a CSet
objects:
EClass
FunHash

morphisms:
1 per function symbol
Maybe functors? Takes multiples EClass

congruence closure does feel like some kind of universal property. It's the largest relation under something

If function symbols are morphisms,
then They can be represented as n-d arrays on the available equaivlance classes.
It avoids the need for a hashmap. At the great expense of being able to be less lazy?
We need like a lazy sparse array. That uses 0 to denote uncomputed.
But a hash table is a lazy sparse array
I guess we could have 1 hash per function symbol. Since we always know the head.
Yea, these forms don't seem useful, but it's an interesting persepctive.

A data structure is a lot like a database

I guess the other interesting takeway that one might have is the other direwction
A hashmap can be like an avluator. memo[ f x y z ] = result.
memo[f x y z] ~ curry ~ memo[f][x y z]
So we don't have to make the correspondence morphism = array

So, where to next?
3 roads.

- implement pattern matching in julia
- bind to egg

E-graphs and E-matching. E-graph were originally proposed several decades ago as an efficient
data structure for maintaining congruence closure [Kozen 1977; Nelson 1980; Nelson and Oppen
1980]. E-graphs continue to be a critical component in successful SMT solvers where they are
used for combining satisfiability theories by sharing equality information [De Moura and Bjørner
2008]. A key difference between past implementations of e-graphs and egg’s e-graph is our novel
rebuilding algorithm that maintains invariants only at certain critical points (Section 3). This makes
egg more efficient for the purpose of equality saturation. egg implements the pattern compilation
strategy introduced by de Moura et al. [de Moura and Bjørner 2007] that is used in state of the art
theorem provers [De Moura and Bjørner 2008]. Some provers [De Moura and Bjørner 2008; Detlefs
et al. 2005] propose optimizations like mod-time, pattern-element and inverted-path-index to find
new terms and relevant patterns for matching, and avoid redundant matches. So far, we have found
egg to be faster than several prior e-graph implementations even without these optimizations.
They are, however, compatible with egg’s design and could be explored in the future. Another key
difference is egg’s powerful e-class analysis abstraction and flexible interface. They empower the
programmer to easily leverage e-graphs for problems involving complex semantic reasoning

position sdtrings. We can lay out the terms in some sequence, let's say a preorder traversal. In addition can annotate with positions
This does actually remind me of Code2Vec

It seems like having a slow but interpretable e matcher would be helpful. 


bjorner and de moura good ematching
prolog - warren machine

 pc - current instruction ? weird.
