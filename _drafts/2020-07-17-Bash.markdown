There is a thing I've heard that bash and piping is shockingly performant for some tasks. Stream processing and stuff.







You can kind of get database operations  







  * wc - word count
  * grep
  * head
  * sort - can sort of columns?
  * uniq
  * awk - all kinds of crap
  * join
  * seq 1 100
