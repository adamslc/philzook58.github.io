I"»<p>Last time <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/a-touch-of-topological-quantum-computation-in-haskell-pt-i/">we built the basic pieces we need</a> to describe anyons in Haskell. Anyon models describe interesting physical systems where a set of particles (Tau and Id in our case) have certain splitting rules and peculiar quantum properties. The existence of anyons in a system are the core physics necessary to support topological quantum computation. In topological quantum computing, quantum gates are applied by braiding the anyons and measurements performed by fusing anyons together and seeing what particle comes out. Applying gates in this way has inherent error correcting properties.</p>
