I"Ö<p>There is a lot going on all at once when you open up a textbook on many body. Also, an insistence (which for practical calculational reasons makes a lot of sense, but leaves a conceptual hole) on using second quantized talk and notations, when before the thing youâ€™re most familiar with and spend years grappling is schroedinger style quantum mechanics. It is not impossible to do most if not all things you do in second quantized form in first quantized form.</p>
