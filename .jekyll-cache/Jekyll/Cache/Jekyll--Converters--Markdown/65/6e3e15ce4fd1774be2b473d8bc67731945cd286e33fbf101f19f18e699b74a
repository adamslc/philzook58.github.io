I"¸<p>I know a bit of Haskell. Itâ€™s the functional programming language I have the strongest background in. OCaml is very similar to Haskell, which is why I havenâ€™t felt a strong need to learn it. Having had to delve into it for necessity because of work I think that was an oversight. The biggest thing for me is being able to more easily read a new set of literature and see familiar things in a new light, which is very refreshing.</p>
