I"v<p>The idea is to attempt to use commodity hardware (standard hacker toolkit) to see an NMR signal</p>

<p>We bought 3 disk magnets from amazon. 1.5”x.25”.</p>

<p>Using our magnetometer made from a hall effect sensor, we’re getting that that field in the bore ~0.5T.</p>

<p>Going off a guess that disk magnets have fields approximately that of coils, a helmholtz coil arrangement was attempted with 3d printed parts. The fit of the magnets in there is really tight.</p>

<p>We saturated the sensor (which saturates at 0.3T), but with theoretically the thing is taking the dot product with it’s orientation with respect to the field. A perpendicular sensor does read approximately 0T. So we attenuated the field by tilting the sensor 45/2 degrees off of perpendicular and measured ~0.17T.</p>

<p>For the hydrogen nucleus, this is a resoannce freqeuncy of ~20Mhz.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromagnetic_ratio</a>.</p>

<p>We designed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_coil">helmholtz coil </a>setup (coils that are 1 radius apart. They look unnaturally close to my eye for some reason, but that it just opinion.), Oversizing things that have to fit by 0.01inch seems enough for a snug fit. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>It is quite unclear to me the electrical characteristics these coils are going to have at the design frequency of ~20Mhz.</p>

<p>Here is a GUESS. I haven’t really done much hard work on this. But it’s probably right to order of magnitude. The B is fairly uniform in the helmholtz coil. Basically the same result for a solenoid of same size.</p>

<p>N is number of turns on one coil.</p>

<p>$latex B = (4/5)^{3/2} \mu_0 N I / r$</p>

<p>$latex \Phi = L I$</p>

<p>$latex \Phi = 2 N A B$</p>

<p>$latex L =(4/5)^{3/2} \mu_0 N^2 2 \pi r $</p>

<p>$latex A = \pi r^2 $</p>

<p>Gives an inductance of 7uH, impedance of ~1kOhm at 20Mhz with 10 turns per coil.</p>

<p>This estimate was confirmed</p>
