I"ä<p>So I caught a hiccup</p>

<p>You need to install Xcode probably</p>

<p>Firstoff, you need to install libusb</p>

<p>brew install libusb1</p>

<p>make and install libftdi from source</p>

<p>http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php</p>

<p>brew install python3</p>

<p>brew install gnu-sed</p>

<p>brew install gawk</p>

<p>brew install mercurial</p>

<p>brew install bison</p>

<p>go to icestorm website</p>

<p>Run all the the commands. like it says. Maybe youâ€™ll find more packages that you need installed that I had already. Look at the error and brew install some guesses.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a kicker, go into the makefile for the iceprog and add a 1 to the end of -lftdi so it becomes -lftdi1</p>

<p>I changed the Makefile in iceprog to have the following stuff. I donâ€™t think my libftdi was installing where expected by default</p>

<p>LDLIBS = -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/lib -lftdi1 -lm
CFLAGS = -MD -O0 -ggdb -Wall -std=c99 -I/usr/include/libftdi1
DESTDIR = /usr/local</p>

<p>I guess cc automatically peels lib off the front. Go fig.</p>

<p>Okay. Cool.</p>

<p>Then I git cloned the repository from the hackaday tutorial to see if I could get it to run</p>

<p>http://hackaday.com/2015/08/27/learning-verilog-for-fpgas-hardware-at-last/</p>

<p>./build.sh demo</p>

<p>I got the error</p>

<p>Canâ€™t find iCEstick USB device (vedor_id 0x0403, device_id 0x6010).</p>

<p>Dâ€™oh.</p>

<p>Well.</p>

<p>brew install lsusb</p>

<p>used lsusb. I can see it right there. The computer can see the thing.</p>

<p>Apparently i think the arduino drivers I have installed previously conflicted with libftdi or something, so I had to unload them</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>kextstat</td>
      <td>grep FTD</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Copy and paste the names you find to unload the ftdi devices</p>

<p>sudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver</p>

<p>sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI</p>

<p>finally I got blinking lights.</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>
