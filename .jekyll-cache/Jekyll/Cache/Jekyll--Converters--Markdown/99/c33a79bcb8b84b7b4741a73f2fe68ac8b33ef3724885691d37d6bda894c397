I"{<p>Trying to develop some software for coherent rtl synchronization. This is the first step, using internal gnuradio signal sources. Thinking that’ll we’ll use this setup + a synchronize button that will set the current delay. Or maybe sliders. Would kind of suck to have to synchronize manually every time, but not horrible. Maybe the synchronize button will set the slider values to the appropriate places. And could enable or disable all the extra processing with valve. Okay, did that. Set True to 0 default to 0 and false to 1 in gui checkbox. Then run that variable into the valve leading into all the correlation stuff.</p>
