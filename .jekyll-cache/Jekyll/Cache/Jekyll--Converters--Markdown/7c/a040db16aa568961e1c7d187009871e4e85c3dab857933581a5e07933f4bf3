I"F<p>SO, it turns out we’ve been printing mirror images of parts somehow. We just printed raspberry pi cases and they don’t fit. I suppose we had been printing parts that are too symmetrical to observe this before.</p>

<p>What’s extra bizarre is this makes the coordinate system of the printer not right handed. Now the maximum of x is towards the power supply side.</p>

<p>We played with some stuff in the marlin configuration file</p>

<p>Removed the #define disable_max_endstops line</p>

<p>#define INVERT_X_DIR true</p>

<p>#define X_HOME_DIR 1</p>

<p>Seems ok now.</p>
