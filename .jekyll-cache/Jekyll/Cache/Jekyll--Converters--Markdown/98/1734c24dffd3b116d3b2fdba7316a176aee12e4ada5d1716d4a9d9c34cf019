<p>Redshift from gravity. Fire a photon up. Convert into mass and let mass drop. If energy conserved then you gain mgh of energy where $ m = \hbar \omegaâ€™$, the freqeuncy at the top. Hence you have $ \hbar \omega = m+mgh=\hbar \omega (1+gh)$.</p>

<p>The frequency at the top is reduced by (1+gh), i.e. it is redder.</p>

  <li>Uniform gravity raises no tides? Thatâ€™s odd. naively I would think that the water would flow towards the lowest energy configuration, which would be at the bottom of the external potential. On the total gravitational potential (+ centrifugal force) constant surface. Which does get distorted by an external field.</li>

<p>Oh. I see. Looking at the text, the earth would be freely falling as well. Â Wow. Thatâ€™s an important point. The earth is falling towards the moon at exactly the rate of free fall. Itâ€™s the differences of force that cause the tides. A little stronger on the front, a little weaker on the back. This is sort of the same thing as a draping cloth in a falling elevator.</p>

<p>Canâ€™t raise an lower $ \Lambda$ using the metric. They are coordinate transformations. I believe upper indices are components of vectors and lower indices are components of 1-forms. $ dx^\mu \partial_\mu $ and $ \partial_\mu \phi$</p>

<p>$ x = r\cos(\theta)$</p>

<p>$ y = r\sin(\theta)$</p>

<p>This matrix will convert the gradient into new coordinates</p>

<p>$ \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\theta} &amp; -r\sin(\theta) \ \sin(\theta) &amp; r\cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix}$</p>

<p>$ \theta = \arctan(\frac{y}{x})$</p>

<p>$ r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$</p>

<p>This one will convert vectors into new coordinates</p>

<p>$ \begin{bmatrix} x/r&amp; y/r\ -y/r^2 &amp;x/r^2\end{bmatrix}$</p>

<p>Multiplying the two should give an identity matrix, since inner product should stay invariant under coordinate change. Quite miraculously they do. Try multiplying the two matrices. Nice.</p>
