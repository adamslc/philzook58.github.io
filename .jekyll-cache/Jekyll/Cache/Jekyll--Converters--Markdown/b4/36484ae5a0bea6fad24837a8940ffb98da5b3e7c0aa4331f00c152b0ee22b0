I"u<p>So we bought the Prusa i3 with the aluminum frame from folgertech about two weeks ago. Was tempted first to get a Chinese version off of aliexpress, but I’ve heard tales of long shipping times, plus possibly some kind of importing fee. WOuldn’t have saved much money anyhow. Definitely the way to go. It shipped pretty fast. Got it in about 3 days or so. Noice.</p>
