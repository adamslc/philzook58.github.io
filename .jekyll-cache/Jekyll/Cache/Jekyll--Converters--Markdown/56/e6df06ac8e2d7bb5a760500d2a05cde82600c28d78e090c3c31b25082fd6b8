I"å<p>I had trouble installing the ppa the first time I tried about a month ago. It seemed to go through the second time around</p>

<p>Install LimeSuite using the ppa instructions for ubuntu. I have 16.04</p>

<p>https://wiki.myriadrf.org/Lime_Suite</p>

<p>lsusb shows OpenMoko as the device. Odd.</p>

<p>https://wiki.myriadrf.org/LimeSDR_Quick_Start</p>

<p>Ok. A capitalized command LimeSuiteGUI is insane. No commands are capitalized.</p>

<p>It brings up some spaceship of cryptic options.</p>

<p>Some of the stuff in the top menu bar seems good. Connecting, Programming, FFT, etc.</p>

<p>The commands</p>

<p>LimeUtil â€“info</p>

<p>LimeUtil â€“find</p>

<p>Lists a device. So thatâ€™s good. Also does updating?</p>

<p>Added a myriad RF ppa for gnuradio</p>

<p>https://wiki.myriadrf.org/Packaging</p>

<p>sudo apt-get install gnuradio gnuradio-dev</p>

<p>Also installed gqrx. This is very useful for determining if the goddamn thing is working at all</p>

<p>http://gqrx.dk/download/install-ubuntu</p>

<p>Ok. GQRX was crashing on boot.</p>

<p>So was gnuradio when I tried playing with the osmocom source</p>

<p>GNU C++ version 5.4.0 20160609; Boost_105800; UHD_003.010.001.001-release</p>

<p>ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gnuradio/uhd/_uhd_swig.x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3uhd4usrp10multi_usrp7ALL_LOSB5cxx11E</p>

<p>so did python</p>

<p>from gnuradio import uhd</p>

<p>Eventually I apt get installed libuhd-dev which makes gqrx run now with an rtl-sdr</p>

<p>gqrx with line</p>

<p><strong>soapy=0,driver=lime</strong></p>

<p>should work but didnâ€™t</p>

<p>Hmm another twist</p>

<p>Limesdr is power hungry</p>

<p>I may not have a usb3 port on my 2012 desktop insane as that sounds</p>

<p>so i need external power? I wonder if that is what the blinking led signifies</p>

<p>Trying to install in windows now. Maybe that will work better</p>

<p>Install PothosSDR</p>

<p>After running zadig can recognize an rtl-sdr in gqrx</p>

<p>https://wiki.myriadrf.org/Lime_Suite#USB_driver</p>

<p>Install the drivers as specified for limesdr.</p>

<p>I accidentally installed the x86 instead of the x64 drivers and needed to uninstall with deletion and then reinstall properly. Got error code 48</p>

<p>It appears to be working.</p>

<p>https://wiki.myriadrf.org/LimeSDR-USB_Quick_Test</p>

<p>GQRX opens.</p>

<p>It has been months since I tried in ubuntu 16.04. Maybe things have gotten better.</p>

<p>ok. At first gqrx wouldnâ€™t load but after fiddling with the sampling and bandwidth it does. I donâ€™t get any FM signals with nothing attached to the Lime. That is either good or bad. It does appear to be receiving data at least though.</p>

<p>So I have not gotten gqrx to actually receive signals with limesdr, but gnuradio appears to be working to some degree. This graph plays audio on 101.5 although very crappily. I hope it just needs filtering (I think I should be low passing those resamplers. Also I probably shouldnâ€™t be receiving on the middle of the band where the DC spike is). I doubled the resampler because a single resampler through an error for too much decimation. Is this standard procedure?</p>

<p>ok. Next step is simple transmit and receive</p>
