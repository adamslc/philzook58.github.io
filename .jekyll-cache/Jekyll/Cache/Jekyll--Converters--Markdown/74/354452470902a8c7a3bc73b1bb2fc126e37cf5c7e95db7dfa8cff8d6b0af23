I"ô<p>So I have this parabola project that has been rotting me from the inside for months.</p>

<p>We wanted the build a giant parabola somehow for one of those far away whispering demos.</p>

<p>We tried winging it a little and it failed. Miserably. A horrendous boondoggle.</p>

<p>Then I went back to the drawing board. I made a python program that would construct an approximation out of triangular panels and angled connector pieces.</p>

<p>Then i sent it to Ponoko, but I screwed everything up. Plus I made it full scale without a model one first so it was real expensive.</p>

<p>Then Ponoko didnâ€™t really refund me. They gave me some nebulous credit, which is annoying.</p>

<p>I have maybe fixed it and sent it off again finally. Weâ€™ll see.</p>
