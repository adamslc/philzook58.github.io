I"·<p>What is a Greenâ€™s Function?</p>

<p>While that doesnâ€™t sound like an esoteric question to me anymore, it must to a new initiate.</p>

<p>First off, I think you can achieve immense clarity by understanding that everything that is called a Greenâ€™s function is not exactly the same thing. For problem solving and calculating, the similarity of all the things called Greenâ€™s functions is helpful, since knowledge of one situation letâ€™s you understand how to manipulate the solution in another.
They do all have a similar flavor.</p>

<p>Conceptually, however, the Greenâ€™s function is a many faced god. And for that purpose, it is best to emphasize the <em>differences</em> between these very conceptually different cases.</p>

<p>To start off, for some slight concreteness, letâ€™s list some problems that will have solutions in the form of something called a Greenâ€™s function.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You have some weird potato shaped charge and hunks of metal. What is the electric potential everywhere?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a ball getting randomly kicked around. Given it starts at home plate, what is the probability it gets to first?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a single quantum particle</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a rumbling tumultuous ocean or rubber sheet. How does the height at one place correlate with the height at another?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have a quantum field. God help you.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
