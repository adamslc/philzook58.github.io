I"ò<p>Wordpress has been a source of stress and disatisfaction for a number of years now. As iâ€™ve been writing my blog posts and becoming more invested in it, it has been concerning to watch my Wordpress site rot. The block editor is clunky and nonresponsive and it seems like the thing is constantly being attacked by bots and spammers. For a while there, I couldnâ€™t get code to enter with &gt; signs in it without them being autoreplaced by an escaped version that did not render correctly.</p>
