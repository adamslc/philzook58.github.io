I"N<p>Based on http://fpga4fun.com/PongGame.html</p>

<p>767 was the value checked for at 25Mhz. This is a count of 768.</p>

<p>I doubled it to 1535. and added one to all references to Counter X.</p>

<p>I am confused on these values. References I’m finding say to shoot for 31.5kHz but this works out to 32.5khz?</p>

<p>50e6/31.46875e3 gives 1588.87785501. Ok. That works too. I guess the monitor is just flexible.</p>

<p>I got an error for can’t use pin 101 which is V sync</p>

<p>This helped</p>

<p>Need to disable nCEO which is using that pin</p>

assign vga_h_sync = ~vga_HS;

assign R =  CounterX[9];//CounterY[3] | (CounterX==256);
assign G = CounterX[8];//(CounterX[6] ^ CounterX[7]) | (CounterX==256);

<p>Alright. It appears to work. That is a good start.</p>
