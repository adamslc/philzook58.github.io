<p>Tried to install usb drivers. But it failed. I saw a board that said it should work if libusb is installed. We’ll see.</p>

<p>It wasn’t readily apparent to me how to run the thing. The Mojo site helped</p>

<p>You need to source a file.</p>

<p>You have to get a license from the license manager. It did not automatically navigate my browser. Select webpack license and load it in the license manager. It will be emailed to you.</p>

<p>Hey! It works after a good 30 seconds. Oh my good this looks like garbage. What is going on here? Some weirdo windows port?</p>

<p>Ok. I have a Spartan 6 AX309 board now and a xilinx platform usb cable. Let’s see if we can program it. I asked the seller for the link to their files. It’s  got datasheets and example code. That’s nice.</p>

<p>The programming software is apparently called impact. That’s helpful. SARCASM</p>

<p>Ok. I left this on my desk for a week and forgot what I did. As I recall the installation process did not appear to be working.</p>

<p>Ok. So I think it might be working.</p>

<p>I had concern about getting some kind of ESN error, but I think I was doing things in the wrong order.</p>

<p>First click boundary scan.</p>

<p>Then find Initialize chain.</p>

<p>Then my chip shows up. Then I added a .bit file configuration.</p>

<p>WHOO. The LED BLINK TEST WORKS.</p>

<p>Why do I do this to myself? My Altera toolchain was working just fine. Oh well. Onwards and upwards.</p>
