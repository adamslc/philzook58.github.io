I"•	<p>After a long night we arrived here in Copenhagen on Sunday.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re staying at mattâ€™s friendâ€™s place, Sam. He is very nice to do so, since we are disgusting animals.</p>

<p>The sink here has been filling up with the upstairs neighbors dirty water so draining it into the toilet has been a theme.</p>

<p>The first day, Matt arranged all the travel. Buses places trains etc. That really took all day. I feel kind of bad about being a hanger on piece of crap who isnâ€™t helping with the planning really.</p>

<p>The second day we walked all over town. Saw the harbor, Christiana, the weird commune thing in a park where they sell weed and/or declared themselves independent from Denmark? Saw Bohrs birthplace and the institute where he worked. Pretty cool. Also saw the requisite mermaid statue and a star shaped fort.</p>

<p>We went to aamans, a pretty fancy place, for some smorresbrod, the danish thing. Itâ€™s various things placed on a piece of rye bread. Itâ€™s good. I got boring choices, pig ,beef, fish, while Matt went for more exotic liver, steak tartare, and pickled herring.</p>

<p>I stopped fighting my coffee urges on day 3 in the museum Louisiana which was awesome. The exhibit on William Kentridge was particularly cool. He loves megaphones. The other main exhibit on Tal R, some danish artist, was more underwhelming. Â Iâ€™m just a crass bore so whatever. The view of the sea was great. Also just generally the museum looked good. The building and grounds and scattered sculpture of shape.</p>

<p>after another chill day,weâ€™re off to Brussels.</p>
