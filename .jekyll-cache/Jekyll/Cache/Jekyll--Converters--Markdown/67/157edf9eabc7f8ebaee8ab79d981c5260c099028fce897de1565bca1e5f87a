I"E<p>Iâ€™ve been playing around with Coq and Agda and Idris, doing the exercises in the Software Foundations book. These have similar flavor, using the Curry-Howard isomorphism to use the type system as a way of proving stuff. It may not be an entire coincidence that the systems put in place to tell when you have a float int smash can be extended to full proving systems. The property of never having a float int collision is a proposition that requires proof. And somehow the compiler systematically guarantees it when type checking, without exhaustively running the program.</p>
