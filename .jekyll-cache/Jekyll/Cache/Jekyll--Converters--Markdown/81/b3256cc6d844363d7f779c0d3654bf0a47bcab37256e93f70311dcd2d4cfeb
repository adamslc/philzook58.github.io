I"‘<p>Me and my close friends have been interested in starting a project together and I suggested we use Haskell. I do not think the suggestion was received well or perhaps in seriousness. I have a tendency to joke about almost everything and have put forward that we use many interesting but not practical languages in the same tone that I suggest Haskell. This was a tactical mistake. I find myself in despair at the idea I canâ€™t convince my personal friends, who are curious and intellectual people, to use Haskell on a fresh start web project we have complete control over. What hope do I have in the world at large? This brain dump post is meant for them. My suggestion to use Haskell is not _just _me being an asshole, although that does make it more fun for me. I will now try to explain in all seriousness and in all the honesty that I can muster what my opinions on languages are and why I have them.</p>
