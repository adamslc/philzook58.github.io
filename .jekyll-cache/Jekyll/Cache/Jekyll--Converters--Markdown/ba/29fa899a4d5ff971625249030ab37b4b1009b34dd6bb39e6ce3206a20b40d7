<p>After a very disappointing day trying to use hand twisted wire crankshafts and bottle cap piston tops, we shifted over to 3d printing to make a well dimensioned soda can Stirling engine. We found that the crankshaft sizes has to be really surprisingly small. Remember that things more twice that radial distance over a full revolution.</p>

<p>Things that may have helped: We got those Sterno heat things. Actually it was too aggressive. The steel wool displacer was nearly the width of the.</p>

<p>We kept the floss hole pretty tight, by poking it with a small object and threading the floss through with a needle and running it back and forth until the steel wool weight is enough. It is basically air tight and a little too sticky, but it works.</p>

<p>Mostly everything is 3d printed, with some 3mm screws and 1/8in home depot steel rod for axles.</p>

<p>Currently we hot glued the crankshaft together. A better idea possibly is to print them a little tight and then head the shaft with a lighter and sort of melt it through a bit. Might make for easier assembly.</p>

<p>The free wheeling floss pulley is clutch. We had a lot of problems with binding on our crappy version.</p>

<p>The displacer and piston rod are 90 degrees out of phase. Checkout the assembly in the Onshape document to see.</p>

<p>We do have difficulty with melting parts. The stand in particular keeps melting. Weâ€™re thinking about it.</p>
