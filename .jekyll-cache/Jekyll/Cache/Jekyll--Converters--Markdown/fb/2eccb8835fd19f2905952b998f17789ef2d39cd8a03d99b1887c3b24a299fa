I"­<p>I realized a relation the other day that made me feel like a doof.</p>

<p>The tensored $latex H\otimes I +I\otimes H $ extension of a 1-particle operator H occurs often. This is also the form of a laplacian of many variables</p>

<p>One of the most fantastic properties of the exponential and tensor product is</p>

<p>$latex e^{H\otimes I +I\otimes H}=e^{H}\otimes e^{H}$</p>

<p>I guess that looks okay but it is worth remarking that kron multiplication meshes well with exponential.</p>

<p>While this is easy, the inverse is not. You canâ€™t write the inverse simply in terms of the inverses of H, as you can write the exponential in terms of the krons of $latex e^H$.</p>

<p>At the same time, This operator is roughly the propagator $latex e^{tH}$, which often you use the Laplace transformed version of $latex G(E)=\frac{1}{H-E}$. But that right there gives you an interesting integral expression for the inverse of the tensor extension of H.</p>

<p>$latex e^{t H\otimes I}e^{t I\otimes H}$ is a product in the time domain. Hence it becomes convolution in the Fourier domain.</p>

<p>$latex G(E) =\frac{1}{H-E} (*) \frac{1}{H-E}=\int dEâ€™ \frac{1}{H-Eâ€™}\otimes\frac{1}{H-(E-Eâ€™)}$</p>

<p>Where that star is some kind of kroneckerized convolution. It makes sense that kronecker product in the time domain becomes a kronecker convolution in the Fourier domain. If you do the integral out in an eigenvalue expansion you can see that it does work.</p>

<p>This suggests a kind of interesting method for finding the tensorized sum (Iâ€™m having a hard time knowing what to call it, but sums of the form $latex A\otimes I+I\otimes B$ ) in terms of their original using a numerical integration.</p>
