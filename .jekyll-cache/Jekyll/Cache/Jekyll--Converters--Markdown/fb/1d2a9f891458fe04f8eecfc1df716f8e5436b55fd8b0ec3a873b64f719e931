I"[<p>I like to watch and listen to my coursera videos on my commute. The app has download functionality but the quizzes and crap require your intervention. I need just a block of stuff so I can be hands free.</p>

<p>coursera-dl is a command line tool to download coursera content</p>

<p>https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera-dl</p>

<p>basic usage is like so</p>

<p>coursera-dl -h is a help menu</p>

<p>you can pass in your username and password with -u and -p or setup a ~/.netrc file as described in the README</p>

<p>coursera-dl –list-courses -n</p>

<p>I think it should list courses by default honestly.</p>

<p>This downloads all mp4 videos</p>

<p>coursera-dl cloud-computing -n -f “mp4”</p>

<p>I then made a dirty script that will go through each week and concatenate the videos of that week hopefully in order into a single mp4 file. It is not a clean script. It will throw some errors and build some weird extra files, but it gets the job done. Run it in the course directory</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash

#maybe if you want to pre speedup. It's slow though
#ffmpeg -i input-video.mp4 -vf "setpts=0.68*PTS" -filter:a "atempo=1.467" output-video.mp4

#makes a directory and builds one video per week

#mkdir videos

for D in `find . -type d` -maxdepth 1
do
 #if [["$D" != "videos/"]]; then
 #//Do whatever you need with D
 find $D -name \*.mp4 -print | sort &gt; videolist.txt
 sed -i -e 's/^/file /' videolist.txt 
 ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i videolist.txt -codec copy ./$D.mp4
#fi
done
</code></pre></div></div>
