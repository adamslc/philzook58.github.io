I"B<p>I’d heard that pifm, the raspberry pi radio pin thing used 1-bit quantization techniques. I was wondering what they were.</p>

<p>The basic idea of no free lunch states that you can trade the very high speed excess of a fast digital circuit for more effective bit depth of reconstruction.</p>

<p>A natural technique is pulse width modulation, but then you need an integration stage. Low pass filtering elements are more common. Sigma-Delta conversion is a technique that pushes quantization noise into higher frequencies such that a low pass filter will reconstruct the signal well. Pins natural have capacitance so you might get a low pass filter with no external circuitry at all if you’re going really ghetto.</p>

<p>I did some things with dithering and Sigma-delta in python. Interesting.</p>

<p>Some scattered thoughts:</p>

<p>When sampling a signal into the digital world, you have to break it up into finite discrete chunks.</p>

<p>This distorts the thing. Question is how much and how should you do it?</p>

<p>The simplest scheme is to break the signal up into expected intervals and count them off.</p>

<p>This does not get all out of the signal.</p>

<p>One model for discussing this is quantization noise. We can assume that the error introduced is uncorrelated with the input and is just additive noise.</p>

<p>If it’s quantized in steps of $ \Delta$</p>

<p>$ \Delta$</p>

<p>6n dB. For n bits be get another 6n of signal to noise.</p>

<p>Update: This seems like an interesting resource to dig into</p>
