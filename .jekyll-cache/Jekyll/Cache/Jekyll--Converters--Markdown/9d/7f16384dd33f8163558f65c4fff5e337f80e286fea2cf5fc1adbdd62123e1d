I"f<p>Hi, I’m Philip Zucker!</p>

<p>I’m a physics/computer boy trying to find his place in the world. I try to keep this site fast and loose to encourage posting, sort of in the style of lab notebook. So, it’s not always in the most readable form for others. Sorry about that. I’m happy to answer any questions. You can contact me in the comments or at <a href="https://twitter.com/sandmouth">@sandmouth</a> on Twitter. My Github is at <a href="https://github.com/philzook58">https://github.com/philzook58</a></p>

<p>If you’re looking for some technical consultancy, we’d love to hear from you at <a href="http://www.perciplex.com/">Perciplex LLC</a>.</p>
