I"<p><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/a-short-skinny-on-relations-towards-the-algebra-of-programming/">Last time</a>,  I tried to give a primer of relations and relational algebra using the Haskell type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type Rel a b = [(a,b)]</code>. In this post we’re going to look at these ideas from a slightly different angle. Instead of encoding relations using value level sets, we’ll encode relations in the type system.  The <a href="https://github.com/scmu/aopa">Algebra of Programming Agda repo</a> and the papers quoted therein are very relevant, so if you’re comfortable wading into those waters, give them a look. You can find my repo for <a href="https://github.com/philzook58/rel/blob/master/src/ProRel.hs">fiddling here</a></p>
