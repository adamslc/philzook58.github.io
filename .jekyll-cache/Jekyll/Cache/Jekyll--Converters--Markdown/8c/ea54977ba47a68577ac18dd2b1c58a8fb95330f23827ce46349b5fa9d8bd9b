I"œ<p>Iâ€™ve been been on a kick learning about some cool math topics. In particular, I busted out my copy of Concrete Mathematics (awesome book) and was reading up on the number theory section. Bezoutâ€™s identity is that if you have ma+nb=d for some m,n and d divides a and b, then d is the greatest divisor of a and b. Bezoutâ€™s identity is a certificate theorem like the dual solution to a linear program. It doesnâ€™t matter how you found m and n or d, Euclidâ€™s algorithm or brute search, but once youâ€™ve found that certificate, you know you have the biggest divisor. Pretty cool. Suppose you have some other common divisor dâ€™. That means xdâ€™=a and ydâ€™=b. Subsitute this into the certificate. m(xdâ€™)+n(ydâ€™)=(mx+ny)dâ€™ =d. This means dâ€™ is a divisor of d. But the divisor relation implies the inequality relation (a divisor is always less than or equal to the thing it divides). Therefore dâ€™&lt;=d.</p>
