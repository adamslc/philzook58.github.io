I"<p>This morning I got a DM saying that a third party had seen some kind of plugin installation popup show up on my website, specifically on my about me page.</p>

<p>If you experience anything like this PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  (comments below, or DM me @sandmouth <a href="https://twitter.com/SandMouth">https://twitter.com/SandMouth</a> )</p>

<p>I haven’t been able to replicate this behavior in any way, nor can anyone else I’ve asked, upon cursory examination of the code of my blog I can’t find anything, everything is up to date, and scans aren’t finding anything.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s time to finally transfer out of wordpress. I liked that it was easy, but the internet is too scary.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re a hacker, please pick on someone else. I really like my blog.</p>
