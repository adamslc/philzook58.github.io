<p>A simple graph where you can see a peak move as you move the microphone closer and farther from the speaker.</p>

<p>Uses the FFT method to compute the cross-correlation between the source signal and the microphone signal.</p>

<p>The source signal is a random binary signal. The repetition of 2 helpful I think because of the window applied in the Fourier Transform elements. Since a binary signal at the sampling rate has a lot of high frequency components, I hypothesize that Even a very sharp low pass filter might hurt. Repetition ought to push the signal somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.</p>

<p>Suggestion:</p>

<p>Could use averaging to increase signal level.</p>

<p>The plan is to master the sonic case, where the electronics is much simpler, and then move into using my LimeSDR attached to IR diodes for a DIY Lidar unit. Weâ€™ll see where we get.</p>

<p>An interesting package that i should have investigated first</p>
