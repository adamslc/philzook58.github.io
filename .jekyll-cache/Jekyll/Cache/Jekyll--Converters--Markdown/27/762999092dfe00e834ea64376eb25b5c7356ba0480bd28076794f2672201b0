<p>Iâ€™m impressed with the package in the box. Well organanized.</p>

<p>Putting it together took maybe 4 hours, half watching The Wire.</p>

<p>The x-axis screw is not fitting. Iâ€™m hoping the end is just ground incorrectly.</p>

<p>Nope. This has been a huge pain. They sent me the wrong screw. There are 8mm 4mm and 2mm pitch T8 rods. They have 1 2 and 4 starts to their threading. I have bought the maximal number of incorrect rods. I now have in posession the 4mm pitch rod I need. Figuring this out has set me back a month and another 30$. I am annoyed.</p>

<p>There is a crack in the z-axis printed part. Epoxy should fix it.</p>

<p>Hmm. LinuxCNC is more complicated than I thought. It seems installing it on my regular ubuntu 14.04 is not an option without a lot of dangerous futzing. Uses a real-time special kernel.</p>

<p>whenever it didnâ€™t work i apt-get installed whatever was missing.</p>

<p>I also had to add a non redistributable when that error came up.</p>
