I"<p>I watched the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/">Stephen Boyd course</a> to get me started in convex programming. At the beginning, he spends some time talking about convex sets rather than launching in convex optimization. I did not appreciate this sufficiently on the first pass. Convex sets are a very geometric topic and I think that for the most part, convex functions are best thought as a special case of them. The epigraph of a scalar valued convex function on $ R^d$ , the filled in area above a graph, is a d+1 dimensional convex set. Convex constraints on the domain can be thought of as further cutting this shape. Finding the minimum of the shape can be thought of as a geometrical problem of finding the furthest point in the -y direction.</p>
