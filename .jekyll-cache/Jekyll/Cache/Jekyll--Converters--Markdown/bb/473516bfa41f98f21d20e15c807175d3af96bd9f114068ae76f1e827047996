I"«<p>Bought one of these discovery boards for 15$ from digikey. I like the built in stuff, like the 9axis mems device. I donâ€™t enjoy wiring up little boards particularly and it makes every project so ephemeral.</p>

<p>I am concerned that I should have gotten the older board.</p>

<p>User manual has pin connectors</p>

<p>Itâ€™s in platform.io as</p>

<p>disco_f411ve</p>

<p>Huh it only supports STM32Cube? I kind of wanted to try libOpenCM3</p>

<p>start a project with</p>

<p>platformio init â€“boardÂ disco_f411ve</p>

<p>platformio run</p>

<p>The examples are invaluable</p>

<p>https://github.com/platformio/platform-ststm32/tree/develop/examples</p>

<p>ok. There is a blink for the Hardware abstraction layer (HAL) and Low level (LL)</p>

<p>Hmm. Neither blink examples work off the bat. SYS_CLOCK is undefined for Low level</p>

<p>and board not supported in the HAL.</p>

<p>Alright letâ€™s try libopencm3</p>

<p>https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples</p>

<p>make in top directory first</p>

<p>follow directions to init submodule</p>

<p>alirght I guess I need to download the arm toolchain</p>

<p>https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads</p>

<p>I put them on my path</p>

<p>export PATH=~/Downloads/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major/bin:$PATH</p>

<p>Then ran make</p>

<p>also need to apt install gawk</p>

<p>editted the Makefile of miniblink</p>

<p>https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/blob/master/ld/devices.data</p>

<p>stm32f411re stm32f4 ROM=512K RAM=128K</p>

<p>thatâ€™s the right config even though re is wrong</p>

<p>Okay was getting weird error</p>

<p>sudo make flash V=1</p>

<p>the V=1 gives verbose</p>

<p>I may have had to apt install openocd?</p>

<p>Need to run under sudo. Go fig.</p>

<p>Alright got some blinking! WOOO</p>

<p>Ah I see. PD12 is PortD12. Makes sense.</p>
