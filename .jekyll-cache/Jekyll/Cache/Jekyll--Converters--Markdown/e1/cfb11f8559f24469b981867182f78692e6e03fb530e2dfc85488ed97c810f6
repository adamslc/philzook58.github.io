I"¾<p>A simplistic picture of the Landauer-Buttiker picture says that the states in a 1-d ish system are quantized. Either your reservoir is filling that pipe or it doesnâ€™t depending on hour energy levels line up. Thatâ€™s how you get quantized conductance. (alternatively, to current is proportional to the velocity of electrons times the density of electrons, which is inversely proportional to velocity in 1-d. the two factors cancel out.)</p>
