I"Ü<p>Graphviz is a graph visualization tool <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/">https://www.graphviz.org/</a>. In Conal Elliottâ€™s Compiling to categories <a href="http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/">http://conal.net/papers/compiling-to-categories/</a>, compiling code to its corresponding graphviz representation was one very compelling example. These graphs are very similar to the corresponding string diagram of the monoidal category expression, but they also look like boolean circuit diagrams. Besides in Conal Elliottâ€™s Haskell implementation, there is an implementation in the Julia Catlab.jl project <a href="https://epatters.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/">https://epatters.github.io/Catlab.jl/stable/</a></p>
