I"™<p>So Iâ€™m intrigued by the promising use of python, fast dev and all that.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m having a lot of trouble getting buildozer to work though</p>

<p>My application keeps crashing.</p>

<p>I have not successfully gotten buildozer to not crash.</p>

<p>Maybe itâ€™ll work on iphone?</p>

<p>However, the kivy launcher app seems to be workingon my android (Galaxy SIII).</p>

<p>make a folder on the drive the phone appears as called kivy</p>

<p>Then another folder for each program with the python and an android.txt</p>

<p>Plyer has the juiciest stuff</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kivy/plyer">https://github.com/kivy/plyer</a></p>

<p>Mmm Juicy.</p>
