I"›<p>A playlist I keep in no particular order. In particular I recommend Gottesmanâ€™s Quantum Information Course from Perimeter Institute which has tons of other interesting physics courses and colloquia as well. Â Also check out the CSSQI lectures. Some of these videos are just links to a whole glut of connected videos from the same people, so look on the sidebar and at other videos from the same users.</p>
