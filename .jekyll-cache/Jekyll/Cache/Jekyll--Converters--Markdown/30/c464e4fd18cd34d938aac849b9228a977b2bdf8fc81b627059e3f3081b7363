I"Þ<p><a href="http://www.declanoller.com">Declan</a> had the good idea to make a CNC machine. There is a popular plan available here</p>

<p>The really cute part of it is using electrical conduit as rails, which are shockingly inexpensive. Like a couple bucks for 4 feet! Holy shnikes!</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve been printing up a storm for the last couple weeks. A ton of parts!</p>

<p>We already had a lot of motors and stuff lying around. Declan bought a lot of stuff too just for this. Assorted bearings and bolts. The plans have a bill of materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.repetier.com/">Repetier host</a> seemed to work pretty well for controlling the board</p>

<p>Used the RAMPS branch of the mpcnc marlin repo</p>

<p>Edited the header files as described in this post so that we could use both extruders as extra x and y  motor drivers. It did not seem like driving two motors from the same driver board was acceptable. Our bearings are gripping the rails a little too tight. It is tough to move.</p>

<p>Some useful links on the thingiverse version of the mpccnc <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:724999">https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:724999</a></p>

<p>He suggests using this program <a href="http://www.estlcam.com/">http://www.estlcam.com/</a>  Seem like windows only? ugh.</p>

<p>The mpcnc plans donâ€™t contain actual tool mounts but here are some examples</p>

<p>This is an interesting web based g-code maker. Ultimately a little to janky though. It works good enough to get started <a href="http://jscut.org/jscut.html">http://jscut.org/jscut.html</a> . Not entirely clear what pocket vs interior vs whatever is. engrave sort of seemed like what I wanted. Went into inkscape with a reasonable png and traced bitmapped it, then object to path. Itâ€™s also nice to just find an svg on the internet</p>

<p>The following code was needed to zero repetier and the RAMPS at the touch off point. We added it as a macro. It is doing some confusing behavior though.</p>

<p>pycam is the best I can find for 3d machining. Havenâ€™t actually tried it yet</p>

<p><a href="http://pycam.sourceforge.net/getting-started/">http://pycam.sourceforge.net/getting-started/</a></p>

<p>We should probably upgrade the thing to have limit switches. It pains me every time we slam it into the edge.</p>

<p>All in all, a very satisfying project. Hope we build something cool with it.</p>
