I"l<p>So I took a mega bus to JFK on June 1. Penn Station at rush hour was a vision of Hell. I watched some Lenny Suss on the ride. Damn, that guy knows what’s up. Then an all nighter to Stockholm and arrived around 2. I’m not built for planes. Is anybody? Tiny little things? It makes my hips feel like their falling out of their sockets and my feet spasm.</p>
