I"R<p>So I took a mega bus to JFK on June 1. Penn Station at rush hour was a vision of Hell. I watched some Lenny Suss on the ride. Damn, that guy knows what’s up. Then an all nighter to Stockholm and arrived around 2. I’m not built for planes. Is anybody? Tiny little things? It makes my hips feel like their falling out of their sockets and my feet spasm.</p>

<p>I exude a gelatin so that I can crawl over the knife.</p>

<p>Swedes have bird noises in their elevators instead of Muzak at least in that one elevator to the Atlanta Express. That’s nice.</p>

<p>We ordered something in Swedish. Everybody here speaks English basically so we didn’t have to. Matt in a happy accident ate fish eggs. I got some kind of herring.</p>

<p>We eventually got some meatballs. They were ok. Kind of like round Salisbury steak? They were good because it was a nice place.</p>

<p>we also saw this outdoor concert and the Swedish Bruce Springsteen.</p>

<p>Went to the Nobel museum. Saw that kosterlitz thouless plot in the case like I saw at the colloquia. Also went to the fotogratiska or something. It was a cool photography museum with an exhibit “like a horse”. Highlights include the bowcoy, the skinned horse face and the guilded poop.</p>

<p>we also were outside the abba museum and saw the YouTube stars of Sweden walk a red carpet. Gold tubes 2017 Woooooooooooo!</p>

<p>it turned out that we arrived the weekend of the Stockholm marathon. And we hadn’t pre booked a hostel, probably because when we were doing our big planning session we thought we might be staying with Matt’s family and then never thought about it again. We lucked out to get a room that cancelled the first night. The second night we kind of gave up on and resigned ourselves to an all nighter on the streets of Stockholm</p>

<p>Max burger as pretty good. Stayed there’s most of the night when the clubs wouldn’t let our schlubby selves in.</p>

<p>The swedes do not let you lie down in train stations. Cops woke me up twice.</p>

<p>Slept on the train toCopenhagen on Sunday morning and here we are.<a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0285.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0285-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0285" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0286.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0286-300x169.jpg" alt="img_0286" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0287.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0287-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0287" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0289.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0289-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0289" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0291.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0291-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0291" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0292.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0292-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0292" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0294.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0294-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0294" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0296.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0296-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0296" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0298.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0298-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0298" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0299.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0299-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0299" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0301.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0301-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0301" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0302.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0302-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0302" /></a> <a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0303.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0303-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0303" /></a><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0301.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0301-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0301" /></a><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0298.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0298-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0298" /></a><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0287.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0287-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0287" /></a><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0285.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0285-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0285" /></a><a href="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0299.jpg"><img src="http://www.philipzucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_0299-300x225.jpg" alt="img_0299" /></a></p>
