I"¯<p>I was following mac install instructions</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source">http://wiki.ros.org/jade/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source</a></p>

<p>, but the pip instruction failed. I turned off the anaconda distro I recently installed by commenting out the line in my ~/.profile file</p>

<p>assimp.hpp not found or some stuff</p>

<p>brew info assimp</p>

<p>brew install ros/deps/pyassimp</p>

<p>I give up on mac. It sucks. Using an ubuntu virtual box. Setup is super easy. Mostly just a apt-get</p>

<p>So what is ROS? Well, my impression is that itâ€™s focus is kind of like unix piping. Itâ€™s a uniform interface you can use to ram little chunks of programs into one another.</p>

<p>But also the community just has a bunch of robotics programs</p>

<p>rviz</p>

<p>urdf</p>

<p>gazebo</p>

<p>pcl</p>

<p>Check this outÂ <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/visp">http://wiki.ros.org/visp</a>. Depending on how well this works could be pretty cool.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install ros-jade-visp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You need to be running roscore in another window for stuff to work</p>

<p>had problems at catkin_make</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="pln"&gt;pip install catkin_pkg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>nope.</p>

<p>Okay the problem I had was that a weirdo python distro had been install doing something else (Goddamn you Moose. What gives you the right?), so I removed it and had to rerun all the workspace creation stuff. Now weâ€™re good</p>
