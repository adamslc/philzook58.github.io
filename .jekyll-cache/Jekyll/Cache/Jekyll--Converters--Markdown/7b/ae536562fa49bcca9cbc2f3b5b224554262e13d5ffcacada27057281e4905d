I"}<p>Today we arrived in Ghent. We’re staying on this eco hostel boat. It’s really nice.</p>

<p>We wondered around the old city. It’s like boom boom boom down there. The churches are bonkers.</p>

<p>I feel like there kind of was less interesting going on. Yes the old buildings were insane and nonstop, but that got a touch old? Am I already getting blasé about Europe shit?</p>

<p>Despite that misgiving, again it was basically the most gorgeous city I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>had waterzooi for linner. Very good. It’s like a creamed chicken soup with lots of veggies. Matt is freaking out (in a positive way) about his.</p>
