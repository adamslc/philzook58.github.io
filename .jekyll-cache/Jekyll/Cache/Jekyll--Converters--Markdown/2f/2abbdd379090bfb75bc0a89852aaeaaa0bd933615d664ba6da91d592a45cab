I"ã<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound">Branch and bound</a> is a useful problem solving technique. The idea is, if you have a minimization problem you want to solve, maybe there is a way to relax the constraints to an easier problem. If so, the solution of the easier problem is a lower bound on the possible solution of the hard problem. If the solution of the easier problem just so happens to also obey the more constrained hard problem, then it must also be the solution to the hard problem. You can also use the lower bound coming from a relaxed problem  to prune your search tree for the hard problem. If even the relaxed problem doesnâ€™t beat the current best found, donâ€™t bother going down that branch.</p>
