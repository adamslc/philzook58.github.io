I"k<p>I’ve started going through a free course offered by Stanford</p>

<p>Seems pretty good.  A difficulty I’m having is that I’m familiar-ish enough to get bored sometimes but not so familiar that there aren’t a lot of jewels i didn’t have down.</p>

<p>So,, I’ve gotten through the first section and here is a summary of some of the choicest bits:</p>

<p>network ports are part of TCP. Guess I didn’t know that.</p>

<p>Home routers are doing NAT (Network address translation). To the outside world you have an IP address and a port that maps to internal IP and ports in your internal network. The router stores a table .</p>

<p>There is a rhyme and reason to the assignments of IP, both logical and geographical. Routing happens by sort of a wild card matching inside an internal table inside the router. It finds the best match according to the highest level of the address.</p>

<p>ARP lets ethernet or find out IPs for devices on the local physical link.</p>
